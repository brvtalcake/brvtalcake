# Welcome to my little and modest playground
Here you can have an overview of what I'm doing here and what I'm searching for.
## Presentation
I'm currently a french student interested in making stuff for fun, since it's not my job or anything (maybe one day...ðŸ¤”). 
I like to learn and I'd like to contribute to small or medium projects carried out by people of the same level as me, wich first means people for whom programming is a passion, not a profession, so they don't have to explain me everything instead of working.
I'm currently working on three different projects in C, and I have tons of ideas for future projects. I'm also trying to learn new programming languages (I think I'll soon be in love with D since it has nearly all the features a language can have).  
## Types of projects that would interest me
- anything in C, except system programming (or really just little bit)
- development of mobile apps in java, or any projects in java
- actually, just propose something to me, and I'll tell you
